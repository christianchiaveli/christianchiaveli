### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

<p align="left">
	My name is Christian, I am a web developer with experience in both back-end and front-end technologies.
</p>

<p align="left">
	I create websites that help organizations address business challenges and meet their needs. My expertise lies within web apps, and the main languages in my tech stack are .Net, JavaScript, Vue, and of course HTML/CSS.
</p>

<p align="left">
	Iâ€™m a lifelong learner (currently taking a course on different types of architectures for back-end applications). I like to read, try new frameworks, listen to music, go to the gym, and also play card games with friends.
